CTexEd is a Colloborative Text Editor built using Nodejs and Websocket Library. 

Preqequisites:
Install nodejs on server by running install script from https://github.com/malliks/demo/raw/master/install.sh
Install the Websocket Library by running script from https://github.com/malliks/ctexed/raw/master/node-ws.sh

Working Demo can be found ar http://ctexed.mazic.in/ctexed.html

Project consist of Server part (ctexedserver.js) and the client html (ctexed.html)

Ctexted uses the Websocket Library and hence works only on some of the browser which support websocket capabilities.
CTexEd works fine on Chrome 4 and also on FF4 provided you enable the websocket.
To enable on FF
1. Type about:config in address bar and continue by clicking “I’ll be careful, I promise”

2. Set network.websocket.enabled value to true and set network.websocket.override-security-block preferences to true.

3. Restart Firefox browser.

Limitations:
- Ctexed is a very basic version which currently works based on keyboard events, mouse events for seleting/deleting multiple characters are not supported currently
- Chrome browser has some issue with the backspace keypress, need to fix it using keyup event for chrom browser
- User management and doc management are not present currently.

We are working on all the above limitations and will soon be implementing them.
